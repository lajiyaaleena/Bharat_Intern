Task_1: SMS Classifier - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset.  Here, in this task, SVM classifier is used to build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. The unwanted columns from the dataset are dropped and done the data preprocessing by removal of punctuations, changing to lowercase, did tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming and lemmatization. TF-IDF vectorization is used for feature extraction. The whole data is splitted into tesing and training then fitted the model using SVM classifier. The model gave an accuracy of 97.5%. After that model did predictions for the dataset.

Task_2: Titanic classification - https://www.kaggle.com/code/dmilla/introduction-to-decision-trees-titanic-dataset/input. In this second task, I have considered train and test datasets for titanic classification. Various plots have been used to check the relation between the target variable(Survived) with the other independent variables. Data preprocessing is done by removing null values, dropping unwanted columns, and converting categorical variables to numerical. Then feature selection and splitting of dataset was done and the model is fitted using random forest classifier and obtained an accuracy of 0.80. Now the fitted model is used to predict the unseen test dataset.
